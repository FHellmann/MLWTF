# My Smart Home
Smart home is a very intriguing topic in terms of facilitating everyday life in your own home. This project aims to consider the use of machine learning in home automation. The Smart Home will analyze the behavior of the residents and make suggestions on how the house could take on tasks independently in the future. User feedback can be used to accept or reject such routines.
