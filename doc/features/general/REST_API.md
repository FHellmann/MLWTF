# Rest Api
The rest api is used by the web app to request data and start actions.
It's also used for the [decentralized architecture](https://github.com/FHellmann/My-Smart-Home/blob/master/README.md#Architecture) to communicate with other stations.

The api contains interfaces for the sensors and actuators.
The rest api can be accessed through: http://{ip}:{port}/api.
